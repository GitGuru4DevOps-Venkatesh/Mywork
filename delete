Open Git Bash: If you haven't already, open Git Bash on your computer. You should be in the repository directory that contains the branch you want to delete.

Check branches: Use the following command to list all the branches in your local repository:


git branch
This will display a list of branches, and the currently checked-out branch will be marked with an asterisk (*).

Switch branches (if needed): If you are on the branch you want to delete, you'll need to switch to a different branch first. You cannot delete the branch that you are currently on. To switch to a different branch, use the following command (replace branchname with the name of the branch you want to switch to):


git checkout branchname
Delete the branch: Once you are on a different branch, you can use the following command to delete the branch (replace branchname with the name of the branch you want to delete):


git branch -d branchname
If the branch has unmerged changes (i.e., there are changes on the branch that are not yet merged into other branches), you may need to use the -D option instead of -d to force the deletion:

mathematica


git branch -D branchname
Push the deletion to GitHub (optional): The branch is now deleted locally. However, if the branch existed on the remote GitHub repository, you may also want to remove it from there. To do that, use the following command (replace branchname with the name of the branch you want to delete):

perl

git push origin --delete branchname
Note: If you encounter an error while deleting the remote branch, ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete branches on the repository.

That's it! The branch should now be deleted both locally and on the remote GitHub repository
